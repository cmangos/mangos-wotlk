-- Example: for map 430, the database text entry for all creatures normally on this map start with -1430
-- Values decrement as they are made.
-- For creatures outside instance, use -1 000 100 and below. Decrement value as they are made.

-- Comment should contain a unique name that can be easily identified later by using sql queries like for example
-- SELECT * FROM script_texts WHERE comment LIKE '%defias%';
