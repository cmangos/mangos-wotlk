=== Welcome to C(ontinued)-MaNGOS ===

C(ontinued)-MaNGOS is a project with the following goal:

            Doing WoW-Emulation Right!

This means, we want to focus on:

* WoW-Emulation
    This project is about developing a server software that's able to
    emulate a well known MMORPG service.

* Doing
  - This project is focused about developing content!
  - Also there are many other aspects that need to be done and are
    considered equally important.
    So anyone who wants to do stuff is very welcome to do so!

* Right
  - Our goal must always be to provide the best code that we can.
  - Being 'right' is defined by the behavior of the system
    we want to emulate.
  - Developing things right also includes documenting and discussing
    _how_ to do things better, hence...
  - Learning and Teaching are very important in our view, and must
    always be part of what we do.

To be able to accomplish these goals, we support and promote:

* Freedom
  - for our developers and contributers on things that interest them.
    No one here is telling anybody _what_ to do.
    If you want somebody to do something for you, pay him,
    but we are here to enjoy.
  - to have FUN with developing.

* A friendly environment
  - We try to let personal issues behind us.
  - We only argue about content, and not about thin air!
  - We follow the Netiquette (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855).

Documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.
